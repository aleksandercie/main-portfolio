  description: [
    "Hi, I'm Aleksander Gasior from Poland. I'm frontend developer with several years of experience.",
    'I studied mechanical engineering at Cracow University of Technology, where I found my passion for creating websites. I learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript and It gave me a chance to start working at salesmanago. I have very nice memories of that time. In 2019 I decided to start my next studies in IT management at Kozmiński University in Warsaw. I moved from Cracow to Warsaw and I also started my new work in Aza Group. In both works, I was responsible for preparing internet content for e-commerce. I was using HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, Javascript.',
    'In 2021 I started work in Accenture and I was creating new functionalities and maintaining existing solutions on the Magento platform for e-commerce.',
    'I was constantly developing my React skills in my free time. I enjoyed using this technology, so I decided to change my workplace and now I work in Ace Agency for Coders & Employers, where I can create websites and use React.',
    "For sure I don’t code all the time. I'm a really active person. I live in Cieszyn, there are Beskidy  mountains in the area, so it would be a pity not to take advantage of this place. When you see outside snow, I ski certainly. Every year I try to visit new places in the Alps with my friends and have great adventures on ski slopes. My favorite top ski places (Grindelwald Switzerland, Ischgl Austria, Kronplatz Italy) and a lot of different ones I haven't visited yet. When it's a sunny, warm day, I usually bike or mountain hike. Even it's rainy, I go to my workout at the gym.",
